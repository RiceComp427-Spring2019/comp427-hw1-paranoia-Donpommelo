## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Zachary Tu

_Student NetID_: zht1

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: {TSA}
- Assumptions:
  - We must assume that each passenger has highly confidential information.
  - We assume that the employees that screen and manage this information are not computer security experts.
  - To ascertain the safety of the flight, this information must be obtained.
  - We must verify that this information is valid.
  - This information should be stored so that if something goes wrong, responsibility can be properly delegated.
  - It is important that flights stick to their schedules with minimal delay.
  - People's rights and privacies must be respected.
  - Due to the above 2, there must be standards for how serious a risk must be to stop/delay a flight or prevent an individual from boarding their desired flight.
- Assets:
  - Information about the backgrounds of passengers. This information must be stored and kept secure. Also, we must obtain the minimum amount of information possible to determine what is a threat.
  - Information about the flight. It is important that other entities cannot observe or tamper with the plane remotely. Most likely, the structure of the plane itself also has certain industry secrets that must be kept private for business reasons.
  - The physical wellbeing, comfort and convenience of the plane and passengers.
- Threats:
  - The threat that first comes to mind is a terrorist attack threatening the physical wellbeing of the plane and its passengers. This could be done for ideological, political, economic or personal purposes.
  - People could take advantage of the data taken by the TSA to violate the privacy of passengers. If we know that a prominent politician is on a flight, we know the TSA will be sitting on their personal information as a result of standard background checks and have a motivation to illicitly acquire that data for political purposes.
  - Remote threats to the plane while it is in flight. This includes shutting down or altering the plane's functions from a distance.
- Countermeasures:
  - Firstly, using information about passengers already collected by the government, we identify people to prioritize additional physical screening that would be carried out on site. We must take additional precaution to ensure that this information is managed carefully and only visible to the individuals in charge of screening. Perhaps this could exclude the tsa employees who physically perform screening who would just be informed beforehand without actually seeing sensitive data.
  - To ensure that each passenger's identity matches up with who we believe they are, we verify identity using personal documents like passports. This means that we have access to the information of all passengers when they buy plane tickets, so extra care must be taken to ensure that this information is kept secure.
  - The cost of both of these measures is fairly high, but users of this service are already conditioned to having to go through considerable inconvenience while addressing the most obvious avenues of attack. Remote threats are more complicated. To combat this, be hire the most budget-friendly computer security experts to oversee our databases and communication. It would be worth it in the long run to ensure that the software that we use for communications/flight planning is consistently up to date.
  - We should also have physical security, both on the plane, as well as in the vicinity of the take-off ramp. This serves to thwart any physical attacks that sneak past the more sophisticated security, such as a lightly-armed terrorist or a teenager with a laser light.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - We assume that we will need to screen a large number of individuals in a limited time. These individuals are here to enjoy themselves and will be less receptive of security measures that put a damper on their mood. (compared to plane riders)
  - We assume that our physical employees will not be experts on computer security.
  - We assume that we use a venue that already has some basic safety measures in place (fire evacuation routes, first aid stations). If it does not have these.
- Assets:
  - The physical wellbeing and happiness of attendants and staff.
  - The value of the venue and event.
- Threats:
  - The first threat that comes to mind is a terrorist attack due to how many people will be located within a small area. This could involve sneaking in dangerous materials for political reasons.
  - There could be accidental threats as well. In the case of a fire or other similar dangers, people in a crowd pose a considerable threat to themselves if not managed properly.
  - Individuals behaving in certain extreme manners could negatively affect the experience for other attendees. Even damaging or leaving the venue in a poor state would threaten one of our assets. (although i'm not sure this is security's concern.)
  - Economic threats; people sneaking in their own snacks prevents us from scamming them with overpriced concessions, hurting our bottom line.
- Countermeasures:
  - To protect against intentional threats (political or personal) we perform a quick screen on each attendee. This is fairly slow and expensive, but I think it is worth addressing one of the higher priority threats we could face.
  - To lower the time cost of the above measure, we could discourage or even ban people from bringing too many or too large bags, but this would inevitably be very unpopular.
  - To protect against large crowds against themselves in a purposeful or accidental threat, we ensure that our planned evacuation methods are sound. This involves making sure that we obey regulations regarding limits to people within different areas of the stadium and performing regular checks on alarm and emergency systems.
  - Periodically, we could have brief reminders during the games to remind people to be safe, as well as highlight evacuation routes. This probably accomplishes very little, but also costs very little.
